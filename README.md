# Serverless Reference Architecture: Real-time File Processing

The Real-time File Processing reference architecture is a general-purpose, event-driven, parallel data processing architecture that uses 
[![AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda)
This architecture is ideal for workloads that need more than one data derivative of an object. 

In this example application, we deliver notes from an interview in Markdown format to S3.  S3 Events are used to trigger multiple processing flows - one to convert and persist Markdown files to HTML and another to detect and persist sentiment.

## Application Components

### Event Trigger

In this architecture, individual files are processed as they arrive. To achive this, we utilize 
[![AWS S3 Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) and 
[![Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)
When an object is created in S3, an event is 
emitted to a SNS topic. We deliver our event to 2 seperate 
[![SQS Queues](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) representing 2 different workflows. Refer to 
[![What is Amazon Simple Notification Service?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) for more information about eligible targets)

### Conversion Workflow

Our function will take Markdown files stored in our **InputBucket**, convert them to HTML, and store them in our **OutputBucket**.  The **ConversionQueue** SQS queue captures the S3 Event JSON payload, allowing for more control of our **ConversionFunction** and better error handling.  Refer to 
[![Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html)
for more details.

If our **ConversionFunction** cannot remove the messages from the **ConversionQueue**, they are sent to **ConversionDlq**, a dead-letter queue (DLQ), for inspection. A CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send notification to an email address when there are any messages in the **ConversionDlq**.

### Sentiment Analysis Workflow

Our function will take Markdown files stored in our **InputBucket**, detect the overall sentiment for each file, and store the result in our **SentimentTable**.

We are using [![Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) to detect overall interview sentiment.  Amazon Comprehend is a machine learning powered service that makes it easy to find insights and relationships in text. We use the Sentiment Analysis API to understand whether interview responses are positive or negative.

The Sentiment workflow uses the same SQS-to-Lambda Function pattern as the Coversion workflow.

If our **SentimentFunction** cannot remove the messages from the **SentimentQueue**, they are sent to **SentimentDlq**, a dead-letter queue (DLQ), for inspection. A CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send notification to an email address when there are any messages in the **SentimentDlq**.

## Building and Deploying the Application with the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)

This application is deployed using the [AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).  AWS SAM is an open-source framework that enables you to build serverless applications on AWS.  It provides you with a template specification to define your serverless application, and a command line interface (CLI) tool.

### Pre-requisites

* [AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

* [AWS SAM CLI (0.41.0 or higher)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Clone the Repository

#### Clone with SSH

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aws-samples/lambda-refarch-fileprocessing.git
```

#### Clone with HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/lambda-refarch-fileprocessing.git
```

### Build

The AWS SAM CLI comes with abstractions for a number of Lambda runtimes to build your dependencies, and copies the source code into staging folders so that everything is ready to be packaged and deployed. The *sam build* command builds any dependencies that your application has, and copies your application source code to folders under *.aws-sam/build* to be zipped and uploaded to Lambda. 

```bash
sam build --use-container
```

**Note**

Be sure to use v0.41.0 of the AWS SAM CLI or newer.  Failure to use the proper version of the AWS SAM CLI will result in a `InvalidDocumentException` exception.  The `EventInvokeConfig` property is not recognized in earlier versions of the AWS SAM CLI.  To confirm your version of AWS SAM, run the command `sam --version`.

### Deploy

For the first deployment, please run the following command and save the generated configuration file *samconfig.toml*.  Please use **lambda-file-refarch** for the stack name.  

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

You will be prompted to enter data for *ConversionLogLevel* and *SentimentLogLevel*.  The default value for each is *INFO* but you can also enter *DEBUG*.  You will also be prompted for *AlarmRecipientEmailAddress*.

Subsequent deployments can use the simplified `sam deploy`.  The command will use the generated configuration file *samconfig.toml*.

You will receive an email asking you to confirm subscription to the `lambda-file-refarch-AlarmTopic` SNS topic that will receive alerts should either the `ConversionDlq` SQS queue or `SentimentDlq` SQS queue receive messages.

## Testing the Example

After you have created the stack using the CloudFormation template, you can manually test the system by uploading a Markdown file to the InputBucket that was created in the stack.

Alternatively you test it by utilising the pipeline tests.sh script, however the test script removes the resources it creates, so if you wish to explore the solution and see the output files
and DynamoDB tables manually uploading is the better option.

### Manually testing

 You can use the any of the sample-xx.md files in the repository /**tests** directory as example files. After the files have been uploaded, you can see the resulting HTML file in the output bucket of your stack. You can also view the CloudWatch logs for each of the functions in order to see the details of their execution.

You can use the following commands to copy a sample file from the provided S3 bucket into the input bucket of your stack.

```bash
INPUT_BUCKET=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id InputBucket --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
aws s3 cp ./tests/sample-01.md s3://${INPUT_BUCKET}/sample-01.md
aws s3 cp ./tests/sample-02.md s3://${INPUT_BUCKET}/sample-02.md
```

Once the input files has been uploaded to the input bucket, a series of events are put into motion.

1. The input Markdown files are converted and stored in a separate S3 bucket.
```
OUTPUT_BUCKET=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id ConversionTargetBucket --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
aws s3 ls s3://${OUTPUT_BUCKET}
```

2. The input Markdown files are analyzed and their sentiment published to a DynamoDB table.
```
DYNAMO_TABLE=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id SentimentTable --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
aws dynamodb scan --table-name ${DYNAMO_TABLE} --query "Items[*]"
```

You can also view the CloudWatch logs generated by the Lambda functions.


### Using the test script

The pipeline end to end test script can be manually executed, you will need to ensure you have adequate permissions to perform the test script actions.

* Describing stack resources
* Uploading and deleting files from the S3 input bucket
* Deleting files from the S3 output bucket
* Reading and deleting entries from the DynamoDB table

```bash
bash ./tests.sh lambda-file-refarch
```

While the script is executing you will see all the stages output to the command line. The samples are uploaded to the **InputBucket**, the script will then wait for files to appear in the **OutputBucket** before checking they have all been processed and the matching html file exists in the **OutputBucket**. It will also check that the sentiment for each of the files has been recorded in the **SentimentTable**. Once complete  the script will remove all the files created and the entries from the **SentimentTable**.

### Extra credit testing

Try uploading (or adding to ./tests if you are using the script) an oversized (>100MB) or invalid file type to the input bucket.
You can check in X-ray to explore how you can trace these kind of errors within the solution.

* Linux command

```bash
fallocate -l 110M ./tests/sample-oversize.md
```

* Mac OS X command

```bash
mkfile 110m ./tests/sample-oversize.md
```

## Viewing the CloudWatch dashboard

A dashboard is created as a part of the stack creation process.  Metrics are published for the conversion and sentiment analysis processes.  In addition, the alarms and alarm states are published.

## Cleaning Up the Example Resources

To remove all resources created by this example, run the following command:

```bash
bash cleanup.sh
```

### What Is Happening in the Script?

Objects are cleared out from the `InputBucket` and `ConversionTargetBucket`.

```bash
for bucket in InputBucket ConversionTargetBucket; do
  echo "Clearing out ${bucket}..."
  BUCKET=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id ${bucket} --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
  aws s3 rm s3://${BUCKET} --recursive
  echo
done
```

The CloudFormation stack is deleted.

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack \
--stack-name lambda-file-refarch
```

The CloudWatch Logs Groups associated with the Lambda functions are deleted.

```bash
for log_group in $(aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix '/aws/lambda/lambda-file-refarch-' --query "logGroups[*].logGroupName" --output text); do
  echo "Removing log group ${log_group}..."
  aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name ${log_group}
  echo
done
```
